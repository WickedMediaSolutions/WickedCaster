# Wicked Broadcaster project
This is an open source project and I am not much of a programmer I simply have a vision for something better.

# What the goal is:
The main outline of this project is to create an open source radio automation program that is stable and quality and overall free of charge
this is meant for the hobby internet/fn radio person but will be stable enough for a commercial environment.

# Features to come:
- Built in encoders for shoutcast/icecast audio servers
- Sound Carts for instant sound boards
- Remote data access for website plugins to pull information and handle song requests
- wordpress plugin for station info
- flac audio support
- m4a audio support
- MySQL driven 
- Ability to record your broadcasts quickly
- simple intuitive interface for the average person to be able to set up and run a radio station
- automation tools to run a station 24 hours a day with no human interaction
- support for multiple output devices Main audio output and a Cue audio output for monitoring

# The Future is unwritten
I have had this dream for quite some time and am now able to finally get motivated even though I cannot program well at all 
that is not a big deal to me. With the support of others I am confident this project can be seen to fruition without a huge amount
of effort.
